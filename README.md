Instagram Challenge
===================
This is my response to Makers Academy's Week 8 weekend challenge. Our task here is to re-create the world's most famous photo sharing app: Instagram, using Rails.


## Gettting started
 ```
   git clone https://github.com/YvCodeHong/instagram-challenge.git
   cd instagram-challenge
```

## User stories

```
As a user,
So that I am upto date with what my friends are doing,
I’d like to see their pictures that they have shared.

As a user,
So that I can share pictures of my daily life,
I would like to post pictures

As a user,
So that I can express my opinions of a particular picture,
I would like to comment on the picture.

As a user,
So that I can appreciate a photo that someone has shared,
I’d want to ‘like’ the picture.

```

## Technologies

Ruby on Rails, Rspec

## Learning outcomes

## Improvements that can be made

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
